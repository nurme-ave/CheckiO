def popular_words(text: str, words: list) -> dict:
    """
    Determine the popularity of certain words in the text.
    Conditions:
    - the words should be sought in all registers
    - the search words are always indicated in the lowercase
    - if the word isnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value
    
    Previous solution:
    
    d = {}
